# Community Detection

## Introduction

The `communities` command lets you **list and label functional clusters** that rgctl automatically detects in your codebase. During `discover`, the Louvain community detection algorithm partitions the call graph into groups of tightly connected functions. The `communities` command gives you tools to explore these clusters and generate human-readable labels for them.

Communities reveal the implicit architecture of your code -- groups of functions that work together closely even if they span multiple files or packages.

## Use Cases

- **Understand implicit architecture.** See how functions cluster together beyond the package/directory structure.
- **Identify cohesive modules.** Large communities with clear labels indicate well-defined functional domains.
- **Spot coupling problems.** An unexpectedly large community might indicate tight coupling between what should be separate modules.
- **Plan microservice extraction.** Communities map naturally to potential service boundaries.
- **Navigate unfamiliar code.** Browse communities to get a high-level map of what the codebase does.

## Example Project

This guide uses the **CoolStore** (`example/coolstore`). Make sure you have run `discover` first:

CoolStore examples use `-l java` to index the Java backend only (skip Angular/bower).

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore discover -l java
```

## Step-by-Step

### 1. List Communities

List all detected communities, sorted by member count (largest first):

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json communities list
```

**Output (truncated):**

```json
{
  "communities": [
    {
      "id": 187,
      "label": "ArrayList",
      "member_count": 16
    },
    {
      "id": 591,
      "label": "Infrastructure / Common Library",
      "member_count": 13
    },
    {
      "id": 499,
      "label": "Order",
      "member_count": 12
    },
    {
      "id": 174,
      "label": "coolstore.service::getProductId",
      "member_count": 10
    },
    {
      "id": 301,
      "label": "coolstore.service::CatalogItemEntity",
      "member_count": 9
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 1
}
```

**What this tells you:**

- **`id`** -- the community's unique identifier (use with `inventory --by community` and scoped `find`).
- **`label`** -- a heuristic label generated from the most representative member names and paths.
- **`member_count`** -- how many functions belong to this community.
- Largest communities on the Java-only CoolStore index are small domain clusters (e.g. `ArrayList` stubs, `Order`, `coolstore.service::*`) plus an **Infrastructure / Common Library** bucket — not vendor JS.

### 2. Explore community members

Community labels are heuristics (often `package::symbol`). Use the label’s package prefix as a `--scope` on `find`:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json find --type function \
  --scope com.redhat.coolstore.model --limit 20
```

Pair with `communities list` to map ids → labels, and `inventory --by community` for sizes.

### 3. Refresh Community Labels

If community labels are missing or stale, regenerate them:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore communities label --write
```

The `--write` flag persists the updated labels into the analysis results, so subsequent `communities list` calls use the new labels.

### 4. Community inventory

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json inventory --by community | jq '.counts[:5]'
```

### 5. Semantic Search by Community

Use semantic search with community scope to find communities matching a concept:

```bash
rgctl -r example/coolstore semantic index
rgctl -r example/coolstore -f json semantic query "checkout" \
  --scope community --limit 10
```

This finds entire communities whose member functions are semantically related to "checkout".

## Understanding Community Labels

rgctl generates community labels heuristically from member names and file paths:

| Label Pattern | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| `coolstore.model::length` | Functions from the `coolstore.model` package, anchored by `length` |
| `Infrastructure / Common Library` | Cross-cutting utility functions without a dominant package |
| `coolstore.service::getProductId` | Package-prefix heuristic from member names/paths |
| `coolstore.model::APPLICATION_JSON` | Domain model functions related to JSON serialization |

## Benefits

- **Automatic architecture map.** Community detection reveals the implicit structure of your code without any manual annotation.
- **Data-driven boundaries.** Communities are based on actual call relationships, not directory layout or naming conventions.
- **Microservice candidates.** Well-separated communities with clear labels are natural extraction targets.
- **Coupling visibility.** Large or oddly-named communities surface unexpected coupling between modules.
- **Composable with other commands.** Community labels work with scoped `find`, semantic search, and migration planning.
